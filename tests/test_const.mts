Wondering which tennis grip will work best for you?\n\nHow you hold the tennis racquet will significantly impact your tennis game. At least, every tennis player will learn three tennis grips for their forehand, backhand, and serve. So I’ve listed and explained all types of tennis grips with photos to help you easily understand and make you a better tennis player.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/play-tennis-on-court-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nMy name is Lin, and I am a tennis enthusiast. I’ve spent 3 weeks researching all types of tennis grips and reaching out to tennis coaches and pro players about how each position of holding the racquet impact the strokes.\n\nFinally, here is a list of all the tennis grips you can find that can boost your tennis game.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\nKeep reading to find out which works best for you. ????\n\n## 1. Tennis Grips Basis\n\nThe tennis racquet handle divides into 8 sides, as shown in the diagram. All sides are referred to as bevels from 1 to 8 clockwise for right-handers and counterclockwise for left-handers.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/racquet-bevels-left-hander-1024x1024.jpg)\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/racquet-bevels-right-hander-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nTo determine what grip you use depending on which bevels the knuckle of your index finger is placed on.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n## 2. Eastern Forehand\n\n![eastern forehand](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![eastern forehand](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/eastern-forehand-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nPlace your index finger knuckle on **Bevel 3**. It’s used for beginners learning to hit a forehand. Used for fast, flat shots. It can change quickly to the continental grip for volleys.\n\n## 3. Semi-western Forehand\n\n![semi-western forehand](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![semi-western forehand](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/semi-western-forehand-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nPlace your index finger knuckle on **Bevel 4**. Pro players like Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, and Stan Wawrinka use this forehand grip. This grip generates more spin and less stress to the wrist than the eastern grip. Also, it allows for shots farther in front of you and a great defense against higher bouncing balls.\n\n## 4. Western Forehand\n\n![western forehand](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![western forehand](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/western-forehand-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nPlace your index finger knuckle on **Bevel 5**. This grip generates the topspin of all other grips, suitable for slow and bouncy courts. It cannot hit the ball with speed comparing other forehand grips. It’s difficult to change grips and hit low balls close. Ideal for players who have a solid baseline game. Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev use the western grip.\n\nIf you want to know more about which forehand grips you should take, check our article on [Forehand Grips](https://allpointstennis.com/forehand-grips/#recommended-grip) learning how to find the best right grip for your forehand.\n\n## 5. Eastern Backhand\n\n![eastern backhand](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![eastern backhand](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/eastern-backhand-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nIndex finger knuckle on **Bevel 1**. The racquet handle runs roughly parallel to the rest of the knuckles. This grip generates more power but less topspin than a semi-western backhand. The wrist position is neutral. Roger Federer and Stefanos Tsitsipas both use the Eastern Backhand grip.\n\n## 6. Semi-western Backhand\n\n![semi-western backhand](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![semi-western backhand](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/semi-western-backhand-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nPut index finger knuckle on **Bevel 8**. The grip enables you to put less power but more topspin than the eastern backhand grip. It’s more difficult to master than the Eastern Backhand Grip. Beginners should avoid learning this grip, and it’s used least by Pro players.\n\n## 7. Two-handed Backhand\n\n![two-handed backhand](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![two-handed backhand](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/two-hand-backhand-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nPlace your dominant hand on bevel 2, non-dominate hand on bevel 6 or 7, or anywhere in the range from bevel 6 to 7. It’s the go-to Backhand to master when first learning the Backhand. It will increase control when returning serves, low shots, and balls at shoulder level. And it relies on shoulder rotation and proper swing to produce power. Pro players use two-handed backhand: Andre Agassi, Novak Djokovic, Marat Safin, and David Nalbandian\n\n## 8. Serve\n\n![continental grip for serve](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![continental grip for serve](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/continental-forehand-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nYour index finger knuckle will be on **Bevel 2**. Continental is the best grip for the serve, whether you want to serve the ball with a flat, slice, or kick. You need protection and stability to maximize the serve with speed and power. Recommended for all levels of players, even if you’re a beginner.\n\n## 9. Volley, Slice, Overhead, Dropshot\n\nAll these shots are the same family, so they will be the easiest if you hit them with a continental grip (**bevel 2**). It provides the most stable wrist position with the L-shape. It can not only straighten the racket face out on a high ball but also open the racket face up without putting the wrist in a weak position. It’s the go-to grip for all these strokes.\n\n## 10. Which Tennis Grip Is Best for Beginner and Intermediate Players?\n\n**Tennis Forehand Grip**: Start with semi-western (**bevel 4**); your hands will find out what works best for you later.\n\n**Tennis Backhand Grip**: two-handed backhand is the go-to choice for beginners because it’s easier to learn than a one-handed backhand.\n\n**Serves, volley, Slices, Dropshots**: Continental grip (**bevel 2**)\n\n## 11. How to Hold the Racquet Properly?\n\n**Step 1:** Grip the racquet handle with the thumb and index finger; the rest of the 3 fingers are along for the ride.  \n**Step 2:** Make sure the bottom of the racket handle needs to be inside your hand.\n\n### Tips:\n\nYour thumb and index finger will do more work than your pinkie. And rest fingers are curled against the bottom of the racquet handle edge as a stabilizer.  \n  \nDon’t squeeze your racquet too tight, which will cause tendinitis, arm, hand, wrist injuries, or tennis elbow. You can feel that it’s much looser in the wrist and allows more freedom of motion.[[1](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/prevent-tennis-elbow)]  \n  \nTry a fresh overgrip as a tackier grip to prevent slippage and chafing to avoid blisters. Some chafing on the inside edge of your thumb is unavoidable (I have a bit of a callus there).\n\n## 12. How to Choose the Racquet Grip Size?\n\nThere are two methods to ensure you’re getting the correct grip size. One is the ruler test; the other is the finger test. Please note that these methods are for you to narrow down the options only.\n\n### Ruler Test\n\n![racquet grip size ruler test](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20440%20440'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![racquet grip size ruler test](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/recquet-grip-size-test-by-hand-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nMeasure your grip size by using a ruler. Measure the distance from the palm’s horizontal bottom crease to the ring finger’s tip.\n\n### Finger Test\n\n![racquet grip size finger test](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20440%20440'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![racquet grip size finger test](https://allpointstennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/racquet-grip-size-test-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nHold the racquet with an eastern forehand (bevel 3) and fit the index finger of your non-dominate hand in the space between your fingers and palm. The grip is small if there isn’t enough room for your index finger; it’s big if there is space between your finger and palm. You want the index finger to fit with little or no room. It will give you the most comfortable and secure grip.\n\n### Racquet Grip Size Chart\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| US Grip Size (inches) | Euro Grip Size |\n| 4 | 0 |\n| 4 1/8 | 1 |\n| 4 1/4 | 2 |\n| 4 3/8 | 3 |\n| 4 1/2 | 4 |\n| 4 5/8 | 5 |\n\nBetween two sizes? Generally, you should go for the smaller one between two sizes because you can add an overgrip to build up your handle thickness.\n\n**The Most Common Sizes**– Men: **4 3/8 (3)**  \n– Women: **4 1/8 (1)， 4 1/4 (2), 4 3/8 (3)**  \n– Kids: 4 or less\n\nStill unsure of your grip size? Check out our article on how to determine your [Tennis Grip Size](https://allpointstennis.com/tennis-grip-size/).\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nTake some time to experiment with your forehand and backhand, and start with what feels the best for you.\n\nI started with the eastern forehand but ended up somewhere between eastern and [semi-western](https://allpointstennis.com/semi-western-grip/). Understand that your starting grip may change as you become a seasoned player.\n\n![Photo of author](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![Photo of author](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c518caffd34b6e188a689ef00e191b1231818115e063b511c7d29dbe81c27e99?s=150&d=mm&r=g)\n\nAUTHOR\n\n### **Lastest Posts**\n\n**Follow Us**\n\n*Copyright © All Points Tennis*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 8: Alexander Zverev's serve : the typical motion of a right-eye dominant ---\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcf6lu2jyyI\n\nSUMMARY:\nAlexander Zverevs serve is classic for a righty being right-eye dominant.

Players like Novak Djokovic and Alexander Zverev are the best in the world, and they're right-eye\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 10: Alexander Zverev Reveals the Grip and Swing Technique For ... - YouTube ---\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6WtMYV0jaw\n\nSUMMARY:\nTo learn more from Alexander Zverev, visit https://www.topcourt.com/p/alexander-zverev\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 11: Alexander Zverev - News & Player Profile - Tennis-Infinity.com ---\nURL: https://tennis-infinity.com/alexander-zverev\n\nSUMMARY:\nEverything you ever wanted to know about ATP tennis player Alexander Zverev, including the player profile, latest news, and updates. ...

But not all two-handers are alike. The key to understanding Zverevâs backhand is the way his grip and arms work together.\n\n1\n\nSome players hit their two-handed backhand with both elbows bent 45 degrees or more at contact, almost like a left-handed forehand. But Zverev makes contact with his back arm straight, or very close to it. In this shot, there is more initial pull with the front arm, similar to the way a one-handed backhand starts. Itâs followed by a push with the back arm just before contact.\n\n2\n\nA Continental grip with the bottom hand is necessary for this hitting position. Zverev pairs this with a conservative Eastern grip with his top hand. The combination is well suited to taking the ball early, and pushes the contact point further out in front of his body.\n\n3\n\nItâs critical that the top arm remain straight. To try it yourself, set up like Zverev does, with your contact point in front of your body, and with the right grips and your back arm straight. The mental image of that position should guide you as you start your forward swing.\n\n*John Yandell is publisher of the [TennisPlayer.net](https://www.tennisplayer.net/) digital magazine and an instruction editor for TENNIS Magazine.*\n\n1\n\nSome players hit their two-handed backhand with both elbows bent 45 degrees or more at contact, almost like a left-handed forehand.

1997) is a German professional [tennis](/wiki/Tennis \"Tennis\") player and the current world No. 3. He has won 24 [ATP Tour](/wiki/ATP_Tour \"ATP Tour\") titles in singles and two in doubles, and has been runner-up at three [majors](/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)#Tournaments \"Grand Slam (tennis)\"). His career highlights include a gold medal at the [2020 Tokyo Olympics](/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_singles \"Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's singles\") and titles at the [2018](/wiki/2018_ATP_Finals_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2018 ATP Finals – Singles\") and the [2021 ATP Finals](/wiki/2021_ATP_Finals_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2021 ATP Finals – Singles\").\n\nZverev is a former junior world No. 1, and won a junior major singles title at the [2014 Australian Open](/wiki/2014_Australian_Open_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2014 Australian Open – Boys' singles\"). He had an early breakthrough on the professional tour as well, becoming one of the youngest [Challenger Tour](/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour \"ATP Challenger Tour\") title winners in history at the age of 17. As a teenager, Zverev won two ATP titles and upset then-world No. 3 [Roger Federer](/wiki/Roger_Federer \"Roger Federer\") on [grass](/wiki/Grass_court \"Grass court\"). At 20 years old, he became the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since [Novak Djokovic](/wiki/Novak_Djokovic \"Novak Djokovic\"). At the [Laver Cup](/wiki/Laver_Cup \"Laver Cup\"), Zverev has played an instrumental role in Team Europe's early success in the competition, winning the clinching matches in [2018](/wiki/2018_Laver_Cup \"2018 Laver Cup\") and [2019](/wiki/2019_Laver_Cup \"2019 Laver Cup\"). After reaching his career-best results in 2021 and 2022, he suffered an ankle injury at the [French Open](/wiki/2022_French_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_singles \"2022 French Open – Men's singles\"), from which he recovered to re-enter the top 10 the following year.[[6]](#cite_note-7)\n\n## Early life and background\n\nAlexander Zverev was born on 20 April 1997 in [Hamburg](/wiki/Hamburg \"Hamburg\"), Germany, to Russian parents [Irina Zvereva](/wiki/Irina_Zvereva \"Irina Zvereva\") and [Alexander Mikhailovich Zverev](/wiki/Alexander_Zverev_Sr. \"Alexander Zverev Sr.\"). His older brother, [Mischa](/wiki/Mischa_Zverev \"Mischa Zverev\"), born nearly a decade earlier, was also a professional tennis player. Both of his parents were professional tennis players for the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\"). His father, ranked as high as No. 175 in the world, became the top-ranked men's player nationally, while his mother was the fourth-highest-ranked women's player in the Soviet Union. They both moved from [Sochi](/wiki/Sochi \"Sochi\") to the capital to train at the [CSKA Moscow](/wiki/CSKA_Moscow \"CSKA Moscow\") military-run tennis club. The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Alexander's parents could rise in the world rankings. With the [collapse of the Soviet Union](/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union \"Dissolution of the Soviet Union\") imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach. While in Germany, they were offered jobs as tennis instructors. After initially declining, they accepted an offer to work at the Uhlenhorster Hockey Club in Hamburg the following year and ended up settling in the country.[[7]](#cite_note-economist-8)\n\nZverev, nicknamed by family as Sascha (the Russian-language nickname for Alexander), started playing tennis at the age of 3. Since he began playing tennis at a very young age, he has said, \"One day, when I was, I think, one year and five months old, I just picked up a little racket and I was starting to push the ball all over our apartment, and since then, they took me out on the court. I enjoy it still, I enjoyed it back then.\"[[8]](#cite_note-itf-junior-interview-9) When he was five years old, he started to play tennis at least half an hour each day.[[8]](#cite_note-itf-junior-interview-9) He was extremely competitive as a child. His brother, Mischa, said, \"He would not understand or accept that he was losing,\" when the two would play against each other. He would never want to leave the court unless he won the match. He also played hockey and football as a child but decided to focus only on tennis around the age of 12 after an early-round loss at a high-level international junior tournament in Florida.[[7]](#cite_note-economist-8)\n\nWhen Alexander was young, his mother was his primary coach while his father was focused on coaching his brother. He has said, \"I think I have pretty good technique, which my mum did at a young age, so credit to her for that. My backhand, in particular, is 100 percent down to my mum.\"[[9]](#cite_note-telegraph-family-interview-10) While his mother had a more relaxed teaching style, his father \"had a very Soviet way of doing physical training sessions\" that involved doing timed drills for fixed numbers of repetitions.[[7]](#cite_note-economist-8) Alexander's coaches aimed for him to have a riskier, aggressive playing style built around hitting the ball with pace and finishing points quickly. This was a big contrast from how he played around age 12 when his style focused on being an \"unbelievable fighter\" from the baseline in part because he was too slow to go to the net.[[9]](#cite_note-telegraph-family-interview-10) Initially, Alexander struggled to change his playing style. He \"made a lot of errors\" and lost to opponents who excelled at keeping points alive. However, his father stuck with this strategy, saying, \"We must practise fast tennis, aggressive tennis. If you lose today it's no big deal. You must think about the future.\"[[7]](#cite_note-economist-8)[[9]](#cite_note-telegraph-family-interview-10)\n\n## Junior career\n\nZverev played his first junior match in January 2011 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Poland. He is a former world No. 1 junior.[[10]](#cite_note-itf-junior-profile-11) He entered his first event on the [International Tennis Federation](/wiki/International_Tennis_Federation \"International Tennis Federation\") (ITF) junior circuit in early 2011 when he was 13. Near the beginning of 2012, Zverev won his first ITF title at the Fujairah Junior Championships, a low-level Grade 4 tournament in the [United Arab Emirates](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates \"United Arab Emirates\"). He would pick up a lower level Grade 5 title at the Oman International Junior 2 a few weeks later, which led him to begin competing in higher-level events shortly before his 15th birthday.[[10]](#cite_note-itf-junior-profile-11) He did not have much success at tournaments that were Grade 2 and above until the following year when he reached back-to-back doubles finals with [Spencer Papa](/wiki/Spencer_Papa \"Spencer Papa\") at the Grade A [Copa Gerdau](/wiki/Copa_Gerdau \"Copa Gerdau\") and the Grade 1 USTA International Spring Championships.[[10]](#cite_note-itf-junior-profile-11)[[11]](#cite_note-12)[[12]](#cite_note-13)\n\nZverev's early-season success in doubles proved to be the precursor of a major improvement in singles as well. During the European clay court season, he won his first Grade 1 title over [Andrey Rublev](/wiki/Andrey_Rublev \"Andrey Rublev\") at the Open International Junior de Beaulieu-sur-Mer.[[13]](#cite_note-14) He followed up that performance with his first Grade A title at the [Trofeo Bonfiglio](/wiki/Trofeo_Bonfiglio \"Trofeo Bonfiglio\") a month later, becoming the youngest boys' singles champion in the tournament's history.[[14]](#cite_note-15) He also finished runner-up at the [2013 French Open](/wiki/2013_French_Open_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2013 French Open – Boys' singles\") to [Cristian Garín](/wiki/Cristian_Gar%C3%ADn \"Cristian Garín\").[[15]](#cite_note-16)[[16]](#cite_note-17) Zverev had some grass court success as well, finishing runner-up to [Nick Kyrgios](/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios \"Nick Kyrgios\") at the Junior International Roehampton.[[17]](#cite_note-18) However, he needed to retire at [Wimbledon](/wiki/2013_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2013 Wimbledon Championships – Boys' singles\") due to a shoulder injury.[[18]](#cite_note-19) Zverev came close to reaching another major boys' singles final at the [2013 Junior US Open](/wiki/2013_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2013 US Open – Boys' singles\"), but was defeated by the eventual champion [Borna Ćorić](/wiki/Borna_%C4%86ori%C4%87 \"Borna Ćorić\") in the semifinals.[[19]](#cite_note-us-open-loss-to-coric-20) This success was enough for him to take over the No. 1 ranking in late October. Before the end of the season, Zverev also represented Germany in the Junior Fed Cup, leading them to a fourth-place finish.[[10]](#cite_note-itf-junior-profile-11) His last tournament of the year was the Grade A [Orange Bowl](/wiki/Orange_Bowl_(tennis) \"Orange Bowl (tennis)\"), where he was defeated by [Stefan Kozlov](/wiki/Stefan_Kozlov \"Stefan Kozlov\") in the semifinals.[[20]](#cite_note-21) As the top-ranked junior at the end of the season, he was named the [ITF Junior World Champion](/wiki/ITF_World_Champion \"ITF World Champion\"), becoming the youngest boys' champion since [Donald Young](/wiki/Donald_Young_(tennis) \"Donald Young (tennis)\") in 2005.[[21]](#cite_note-22)\n\nZverev played just two tournaments in 2014, both in Australia in January.[[10]](#cite_note-itf-junior-profile-11) He won the singles events at both tournaments, the first of which came against Australian [Omar Jasika](/wiki/Omar_Jasika \"Omar Jasika\") at the Traralgon Junior International. At the [Australian Open](/wiki/2014_Australian_Open_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2014 Australian Open – Boys' singles\"), he was able to defeat Kozlov, who was seeded second, to finish his junior career with a first major title.[[22]](#cite_note-23)\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – Singles:\n\nAustralian Open: **W** ([2014](/wiki/2014_Australian_Open_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2014 Australian Open – Boys' singles\"))  \nFrench Open: F ([2013](/wiki/2013_French_Open_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2013 French Open – Boys' singles\"))  \nWimbledon: 3R ([2013](/wiki/2013_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2013 Wimbledon Championships – Boys' singles\"))  \nUS Open: SF ([2013](/wiki/2013_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Boys%27_singles \"2013 US Open – Boys' singles\"))\n\n## Professional career\n\n### 2011–14: ATP semifinal at 17\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/BMW_Open_2014_-_Alexander_Zverev_06_%28cropped%29.JPG/250px-BMW_Open_2014_-_Alexander_Zverev_06_%28cropped%29.JPG)\n\nAt the age of 14, Zverev entered qualifying at three different tournaments, including the [2011 Moselle Open](/wiki/2011_Moselle_Open \"2011 Moselle Open\") on the ATP Tour, but lost all of his matches. He won his professional main draw debut against compatriot Christian Lichtenegger at a Futures event in Germany in August 2012. At the end of the year, he made his first professional final, finishing runner-up to Florian Reynet at an ITF $10K event in Florida.[[23]](#cite_note-itf-profile-24) Zverev continued to focus on the juniors in 2013 and did not reach another pro-level final that year,[[24]](#cite_note-core-tennis-25) but he did make his main draw debut on the ATP Tour in July, losing to [Roberto Bautista Agut](/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut \"Roberto Bautista Agut\") at his hometown tournament, the [International German Open](/wiki/2013_International_German_Open \"2013 International German Open\").[[25]](#cite_note-first-revenge-26) He also made his [ATP Challenger Tour](/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour \"ATP Challenger Tour\") debut, losing to [Máximo González](/wiki/M%C3%A1ximo_Gonz%C3%A1lez \"Máximo González\") at the [Meerbusch Challenger](/wiki/2013_Maserati_Challenger \"2013 Maserati Challenger\") in August.[[23]](#cite_note-itf-profile-24)\n\nAfter winning the boys' singles title at the [2014 Australian Open](/wiki/2014_Australian_Open \"2014 Australian Open\"), Zverev shifted his focus to his professional career, only playing in pro events the rest of the year.[[10]](#cite_note-itf-junior-profile-11)[[24]](#cite_note-core-tennis-25) Initially, he struggled on the pro tour, failing to qualify for the main draw at his first five events of the season. He did not win a main draw match until he recorded a single victory at the [Heilbronner Neckarcup](/wiki/2014_Heilbronner_Neckarcup \"2014 Heilbronner Neckarcup\") Challenger, his tenth event of the year. One of his losses was a retirement against his brother Mischa.[[23]](#cite_note-itf-profile-24) Zverev made his first professional breakthrough in July when he won the [Braunschweig Challenger](/wiki/2014_Sparkassen_Open \"2014 Sparkassen Open\") for his first professional title, despite entering the tournament with just one career Challenger-level match win and no top 100 victories. Three of the players he defeated were in the top 100, including his first-round opponent No. 87 [Tobias Kamke](/wiki/Tobias_Kamke \"Tobias Kamke\"), his semifinal opponent No. 56 [Andrey Golubev](/wiki/Andrey_Golubev \"Andrey Golubev\"), and his final opponent No. 89 [Paul-Henri Mathieu](/wiki/Paul-Henri_Mathieu \"Paul-Henri Mathieu\").[[26]](#cite_note-27)\n\nAt the age of 17 years and 2 months, he became the youngest player to win a Challenger title since [Bernard Tomic](/wiki/Bernard_Tomic \"Bernard Tomic\") in 2009 and the twelfth youngest in history.[[27]](#cite_note-first-challenger-title-28) Zverev followed up this title with a breakthrough at the ATP Tour level. He entered the [International German Open](/wiki/2014_International_German_Open \"2014 International German Open\") having never won an ATP match but managed to reach the semifinals. He recorded four match wins at the event, including his first career victory against [Robin Haase](/wiki/Robin_Haase \"Robin Haase\") and his first top 20 victory over No. 16 [Mikhail Youzhny](/wiki/Mikhail_Youzhny \"Mikhail Youzhny\") before losing to No. 7 [David Ferrer](/wiki/David_Ferrer \"David Ferrer\"). He became the first 17-year old to defeat a top 20 opponent since [Richard Gasquet](/wiki/Richard_Gasquet \"Richard Gasquet\") in 2004 and the first to make a semifinal since [Marin Čilić](/wiki/Marin_%C4%8Cili%C4%87 \"Marin Čilić\") in 2006.[[28]](#cite_note-Hamburg-semifinal-29)[[29]](#cite_note-30) Zverev had risen from No. 665 to No. 285 after his Challenger title, and his [ATP 500 Series](/wiki/ATP_500_Series \"ATP 500 Series\") semifinal appearance took him to No. 161 in the world.

He also needed to enter qualifying for ATP events throughout the year. Zverev did not qualify for either of the first two major singles events of the season.[[23]](#cite_note-itf-profile-24) He was able to qualify for his first Masters event at the [Miami Open](/wiki/2015_Miami_Open \"2015 Miami Open\") and reached the second round.[[31]](#cite_note-32) During the clay-court season, Zverev partnered with his brother Mischa to reach his first career ATP final in doubles at the [Bavarian International Tennis Championships](/wiki/2015_BMW_Open \"2015 BMW Open\").

A week before the tournament, he took part in the [Boodles Challenge](/wiki/2015_Boodles_Challenge \"2015 Boodles Challenge\") exhibition and surprisingly upset world No. 1 [Novak Djokovic](/wiki/Novak_Djokovic \"Novak Djokovic\") in straight sets.[[34]](#cite_note-35) Zverev backed up this performance in his Grand Slam tournament main draw debut, defeating [Teymuraz Gabashvili](/wiki/Teymuraz_Gabashvili \"Teymuraz Gabashvili\") in a tight match that lasted until 9–7 in the fifth and final set.[[35]](#cite_note-36) He lost in the next round to [Denis Kudla](/wiki/Denis_Kudla \"Denis Kudla\"). Zverev opted to play on clay after Wimbledon and reached another ATP semifinal at the [Swedish Open](/wiki/2015_Swedish_Open \"2015 Swedish Open\") to put him back in the top 100 after one week out.[[36]](#cite_note-37)[[30]](#cite_note-atp-rankings-31) In August, Zverev returned to the United States and competed in two US Open Series events. He notably upset No. 14 [Kevin Anderson](/wiki/Kevin_Anderson_(tennis) \"Kevin Anderson (tennis)\") at the [Citi Open](/wiki/2015_Citi_Open \"2015 Citi Open\") en route to the quarterfinals.[[37]](#cite_note-38)[[38]](#cite_note-39) Zverev's brief rankings drop in July meant that he needed to qualify for the [US Open](/wiki/2015_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_singles \"2015 US Open – Men's singles\"). He succeeded, but lost his opening round match to compatriot [Philipp Kohlschreiber](/wiki/Philipp_Kohlschreiber \"Philipp Kohlschreiber\") in five sets.[[39]](#cite_note-40) Zverev won just one more main draw match the rest of the season and ended the year ranked No. 83 in the world.[[40]](#cite_note-41)[[30]](#cite_note-atp-rankings-31) As the youngest player in the top 100, he was named the [ATP Newcomer of the Year](/wiki/ATP_Newcomer_of_the_Year \"ATP Newcomer of the Year\").[[41]](#cite_note-42)\n\n### 2016: First ATP title, Federer upset, top 20\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Zverev_A._US16_%2826%29_%2829236284193%29.jpg/250px-Zverev_A._US16_%2826%29_%2829236284193%29.jpg)\n\nZverev's first ATP event of the year was the [2016 Australian Open](/wiki/2016_Australian_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_singles \"2016 Australian Open – Men's singles\"), where he had a difficult draw against world No. 2 [Andy Murray](/wiki/Andy_Murray \"Andy Murray\") and was only able to win six games in his opening match.[[42]](#cite_note-43) He bounced back at the [Open Sud de France](/wiki/2016_Open_Sud_de_France \"2016 Open Sud de France\"), reaching the semifinals in the singles event and his second career final with his brother in the doubles event.[[43]](#cite_note-44) During the singles event, he upset No. 13 Marin Čilić, the highest-ranked player he had defeated in an official match at the time.[[44]](#cite_note-45) Zverev then produced a strong result at the [Indian Wells Masters](/wiki/2016_BNP_Paribas_Open \"2016 BNP Paribas Open\"), where he defeated two top 30 players. In the fourth round, he nearly upset No. 5 [Rafael Nadal](/wiki/Rafael_Nadal \"Rafael Nadal\"). Zverev had a match point while he was serving for the final set, but missed a routine forehand volley and then proceeded to lose 14 of the remaining 15 points in the match. He commented on the match point that, \"I missed probably the easiest shot I had the whole match.\"[[45]](#cite_note-46) Back in Europe, Zverev was able to recover as he reached his first ATP singles final at the [Open de Nice Côte d'Azur](/wiki/2016_Open_de_Nice_C%C3%B4te_d%27Azur \"2016 Open de Nice Côte d'Azur\"), finishing runner-up to No. 15 [Dominic Thiem](/wiki/Dominic_Thiem \"Dominic Thiem\"), the top seed and defending champion.[[46]](#cite_note-47) Thiem also defeated him in the third round of the [French Open](/wiki/2016_French_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_singles \"2016 French Open – Men's singles\").[[47]](#cite_note-48)\n\n\"I haven't really grasped it yet.

It was at this time Zverev, who had been using his nickname Sascha, stated in a postmatch interview with Pam Shriver, that he would no longer be referred to as Sascha. Zverev stated that only his close family can refer to him as Sascha, as he was born in Germany and identifies as a German, and does not want a Russian nickname to be used for his professional career. At the [Australian Open](/wiki/2017_Australian_Open \"2017 Australian Open\"), Zverev again pushed Rafael Nadal to the brink, but ultimately lost in five sets.[[58]](#cite_note-59) His next ATP tournament was the [Open Sud de France](/wiki/2017_Open_Sud_de_France \"2017 Open Sud de France\"), where he won both the singles and doubles events.

He also reached the final of the French Open and semi-finals of US Open during his junior career.\n\nHe turned professional in 2013 and won his first ATP singles title as a 19-year-old at Saint Petersburg in 2016.\n\nZverev then became the youngest player since Novak Djokovic in 2007 to break into top three in the rankings as a 20-year-old in 2017.\n\nSo, what do we know about Zverev’s journey to becoming the talented tennis player he is today? This is his story.\n\nEarly Life, Parents And Upbringing\n----------------------------------\n\nAlexander Zverev **(full name: Alexander Alexandrovich Zverev)** was born on 20 April 1997 in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nHis parents, mother Irina and father Alexander, are Russian, and his family moved to Germany from Russia in 1991 before he was born. His parents were both professional tennis players, and his older brother Mischa is also a professional tennis player.\n\nZverev began playing tennis when he was around five years old under the guidance of his parents.\n\n“My parents are very calm,” Zverev said in an interview with [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/07/01/family-values-fuel-next-big-thing-sascha-zverevas-rise-towards/) back in 2017. “They understand what I am doing, and they have both been playing pro tennis so they know how to behave.\n\n“My father is my coach, but when I was younger my mother was guiding me more. I think I have pretty good technique, which my mum did at a young age, so credit to her for that. My backhand, in particular, is 100 per cent down to my mum.”\n\n![Image 3: A young Alexander Zverev](https://www.thesportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/alexander-zverev-young.jpg)\n\nA young Alexander Zverev (Photo: @alexzverev123 / Instagram)\n\nAlexander also credits playing and growing up alongside his brother helped him to develop his game, and it’s a relationship which has benefitted both parties.\n\n“My success has a lot to do with Mischa,” Alexander told [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/alexander-zverev-exclusive-interview-family-french-open-beating-novak-djokovic-a7749666.html) in 2017. “He was the one who always used to practise with me when I was little, when I was a junior.\n\n“I think he’s seen me do well and he’s seen me playing on the professional tour and he got really motivated. I think he thought: ‘I want to play a few more years with my brother, travel with him and play in the same tournaments as him.’\n\n“Also, since I started playing well we’ve had a lot of very long and very intensive practice sessions, which I think helped his game and mine.”\n\nEarly Career\n------------\n\nZverev enjoyed a very strong junior career and made it to number one in the world in the junior rankings.\n\nHe won the Australian Open boys’ singles title in 2014 and also reached the final of the junior French Open in 2013.\n\nZverev made his ATP Tour main draw debut in 2013 at the Hamburg Open, where he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut.\n\n![Image 4: Alexander Zverev](https://www.thesportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/zverev-1200-min-1.jpg)\n\nAlexander Zverev (Photo: Marianne Bevis)\n\nFirst ATP Title And More Progress\n---------------------------------\n\nZverev enjoyed something of a breakthrough at the 2014 International German Open, held in his hometown of Hamburg, Germany.\n\nAfter having previously not won an ATP Tour level match, Zverev – aged 17 years old at the time – reached the semi-finals of the tournament, where he ended up losing to David Ferrer.\n\nZverev’s first ATP title came in Saint Petersburg in Russia in 2016 when he was 19 years old. He beat world number three Stan Wawrinka in the final, 6-2 3-6 7-5 in two hours and 23 minutes.\n\n“This victory is something special,” Zverev [said](https://www.atptour.com/en/news/wawrinka-zverev-st-petersburg-2016-final) after the win. “I played all the finals well. I lost to Dominic Thiem on clay and I could have won against Florian Mayer on the grass… Now I’m very happy with the win, especially over such a great player like Stan.”\n\nFurther Progress And Second ATP Finals Triumph\n----------------------------------------------\n\nZverev continued to make impressive progress on the tour, and he captured his first career ATP Masters title at the 2017 Italian Open in Rome.\n\nHe triumphed 6-4 6-3 over Djokovic in the final to claim the biggest title of his career so far and seal a place in the world’s top 10 for the first time in his career.\n\nSpeaking after beating Djokovic in the final, Zverev [said](https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-zverev-rome-2017-final-match-report): “I’m very happy with the way I played and my performance all week, I think today was one of the best matches I ever played. I knew I had to be aggressive from the first point to the last. It was very important for me to be able to stay this aggressive and not let him take over the game.”\n\nWith the victory, Zverev became first player born in the 1990s to win an ATP Masters 1000 title.\n\nHe then followed up that triumph by winning another Masters 1000 title, this time at the 2017 Rogers Cup in Montreal. Zverev triumphed 6-3 6-4 over Roger Federer in the final.\n\n![Image 5: Alexander Zverev](https://www.thesportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/zverev-1200-1.jpg)\n\nAlexander Zverev (Photo: Marianne Bevis)\n\n“Winning two Masters 1000 titles in the same year is something amazing,” [said](https://www.atptour.com/en/news/montreal-2017-final-zverev-federer) Zverev afterwards. “I played well winning Washington and here. It’s something amazing, back-to-back weeks. I feel great. I feel like I’m playing some of the best tennis of my life.”\n\nThe victory made him first player outside the ‘Big Four’ of Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray to win more than one Masters title in a season since David Nalbandian in 2007.\n\nZverev enjoyed another strong season in 2018 and ended it on a high note by winning the season-ending ATP Finals tournament for the first time in his career.\n\nHe defeated Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 to claim the title, and [said](https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-zverev-nitto-atp-finals-2018-sunday-atp) afterwards: “This is the biggest title of my career so far. This trophy means a lot, everything, to all the players. I mean, you only have so many chances of winning it. You play against the best players only. How I played today, how I won it, for me it’s just amazing.”\n\n![Image 6: Alexander Zverev](https://www.thesportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/zverev-1200.jpg)\n\nAlexander Zverev (Photo: Marianne Bevis)\n\nAt the 2020 US Open, Zverev reached the first grand slam final of his career, where he lost to fifth seed Dominic Thiem in four sets.\n\nThe 2021 season was another successful one for Zverev, with the German having won six titles, including a gold medal in the men’s singles at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nSpeaking after beating Karen Khachanov 6-3 6-1 in the final to claim the gold medal, Zverev [said](https://www.atptour.com/en/news/zverev-khachanov-tokyo-final-2021-sunday): “There is nothing better than this. You are not only playing for yourself, you are playing for your country, and the Olympics are the biggest sporting event in the world. The feeling I have now, and will have, nothing will be better.”\n\nZverev ended the year in excellent fashion by winning the ATP Finals for the second time in his career, beating Daniil Medvedev in the final.\n\n![Image 7: Alexander Zverev](https://www.thesportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/alexander-zverev-large2.jpg)\n\nAlexander Zverev (Photo: Roberto Zanettin / Agenzia LiveMedia / depositphotos.com)\n\nEarnings And Prize Money\n------------------------\n\nAs of May 2022, Zverev had earned a total of US$ 31,767,815 in career prize money for both singles and doubles combined.\n\nLife Away From The Court\n------------------------\n\nAccording to his [biography page](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/alexander-zverev/z355/bio) on the official ATP Tour website, Zverev got Roger Federer’s autograph as a five-year-old and took a photo with him as an 11-year-old at 2008 Halle, which still hangs above his childhood bed.\n\nAway from tennis, Zverev is a big dog lover and he travels around the world with his two dogs, Lovik and Junior (Lovik’s son).\n\nHe is also an football and basketball fan, and supports the German national football team and Miami Heat. He also enjoys playing golf and video games.\n\n![Image 8: Alexander Zverev (Photo: Marianne Bevis)](https://www.thesportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/zverev-1200-min.jpg)\n\nAlexander Zverev (Photo: Marianne Bevis)\n\nWhat Have Others Said?\n----------------------\n\n**Novak Djokovic, speaking after losing to Zverev in the 2017 Rome Masters final:** “He served very well. I just wasn’t able to get any rhythm on my returns. If we would get into a rally, he would smash the ball from the first or second shot. There is no doubt he took time away from me. It happens. If he serves this well and this efficiently, it’s tough to play him on any surface.”\n\n**Karen Khachanov, speaking after losing to Zverev in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics men’s singles final:** “He played from the beginning to the end an unbelievable match. I also played an outstanding match from my point of view, but he was just better today – all credit to him. I was dreaming of gold, but I’ll give it a try at the next Olympics.”\n\nClose\n\nSearch\n\n[![Image 9](https://www.thesportreview.com/wp-content/themes/grv-sports/logo/thesportreview.com/primary-logo.svg?ver=1.5.23)](https://www.thesportreview.com/ \"The Sport Review\")\n\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/thesportreview/ \"The Sport Review on Facebook\")\n*   [](https://www.twitter.com/thesportreview \"The Sport Review on X\")\n*   [](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLS9oQswzMe5Aw \"The Sport Review on Google_news\")\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/tennisheadnet/ \"The Sport Review on Instagram\")\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.thesportreview.com/about/)\n*   [Authors](https://www.thesportreview.com/authors/)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.thesportreview.com/contact-us/)\n*   [Editorial Policy](https://www.thesportreview.com/editorial-policy/)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.thesportreview.com/privacy-policy/)\n*   [Terms and Conditions](https://www.thesportreview.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n*   [Privacy Settings](javascript:GRVAds.showConsentTool(2))\n\n*   a proud member of\n*   [![Image 10](https://www.thesportreview.com/wp-content/themes/grv-media/logo/grv-logo-white.svg)](https://grv.media/ \"GRV Media\")\n*   © 2025 GRV Media Ltd.
